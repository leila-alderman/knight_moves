# Knight Moves

This project creates a function that returns the simplest possible set of moves that a knight in chess can travel from one board position to another. In chess, a knight can move forward two squares and then to the side one square, which gives a knight the ability to [eventually reach every square](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Knight%27s_tour_anim_2.gif/250px-Knight%27s_tour_anim_2.gif). 

[This project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms) is part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

## Using this code

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked reposity onto your local computer.
3. To run the tests, you need to have `rspec` installed.
 - First, check to see if `rspec` is already installed by typing `rspec --version` into the command line.
 - If the response is similar to the following, then you already have `rspec` installed and can continue.
 ~~~bash
 RSpec 3.8
  - rspec-core 3.8.0
  - rspec-expectations 3.8.2
  - rspec-mocks 3.8.0
  - rspec-support 3.8.0
~~~
 - If you do not see output similar to the above, then you need to install `rspec` by typing `gem install rspec` into the command line.
 - Now, run `rspec --version` again to ensure that it installed correctly.
4. Use`cd` to move into the main directory and then run `rspec` to show the tests.
