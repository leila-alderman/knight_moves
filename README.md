# Knight Moves

This project creates a function that returns the simplest possible set of moves that a knight in chess can travel from one board position to another. In chess, a knight can move forward two squares and then to the side one square, which gives a knight the ability to [eventually reach every square](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Knight%27s_tour_anim_2.gif/250px-Knight%27s_tour_anim_2.gif).
